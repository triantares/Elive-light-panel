#b Prevent this launcher from stealing appli from taskbar ?
#{If you choosed to mix launcher and applis, this option will deactivate this behaviour for this launcher only. It can be useful for instance for a launcher that launches a script in a terminal, but you don't want it to steal the Terminal's icon from the Taskbar.}
