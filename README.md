An uncluttered theme with clear colors, based on the original Adeskbar look, adapted to the Elive-GTK theme for E16.

It has a dock with launchers and taskbar. The original second dock. on the left has been removed.
The font text has been changed from grey to black and the rounded corners of the applications menu have been straightened to comply with e16 menus.
